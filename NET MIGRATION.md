# Data-Science
This is a group project
This group project focused on visualizing the net migration across regions of the world
From this project you see countries and regions of the world with the highest migration and those with the lowest migration
You can also make derivations as to reasons for the high and low migrations.
A lot more still needs to be the done on this project especially creating a model that could predict countries or regions that would have the highest gdp in the nearest future, this can also serve to explain some other underlying factors.
